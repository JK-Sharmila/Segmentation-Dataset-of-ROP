## **Retinopathy of Prematurity**

Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a significant cause of childhood blindness, particularly
affecting infants born prematurely. It is characterized by the abnormal vaso-proliferation of blood
vessels in the retina, which can lead to complications such as retinal detachment. It is primarily
classified into three stages: early, middle, and late stage. The critical need for early diagnosis is
further complicated by a less availability of high-quality segmentation images, which are essential
for training artificial intelligence models.



**Segmentation Dataset of ROP** (Under Development)

This repository features a dataset for segmenting images of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), designed to enhance early diagnosis and decrease the incidence of ROP through better detection techniques. The original image folder includes fundus images for stage 1 (mild), stage 2 (moderate), and stage 3 (severe) ROP. The annotated folder provides anomaly mapping corresponding to each stage of ROP.
