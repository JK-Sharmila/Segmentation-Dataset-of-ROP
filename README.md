**Retinopathy of Prematurity**

Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a significant cause of childhood blindness, particularly
affecting infants born prematurely. It is characterized by the abnormal vaso-proliferation of blood
vessels in the retina, which can lead to complications such as retinal detachment. It is primarily
classified into three stages: early, middle, and late stage. The critical need for early diagnosis is
further complicated by a less availability of high-quality segmentation images, which are essential
for training artificial intelligence models.



**Segmentation Dataset of ROP** (Under Development)

This repository contains a dataset for the segmentation of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) images, aimed at facilitating early diagnosis and reducing the prevalence of ROP through improved detection methods.
